Hi, I am working on this personal project, including front-end and back-end.\
Because I haven't deployed it yet, I made this short video to demonstrate what this app can do for you to quickly grasp it.\

# Idea
I designed it to help people learning English get better at speaking numbers. 
 It might sound silly, but many language learners struggle with this, including me. 
Even though we can count from 1 to 100 in English, reading numbers randomly can be tricky. 
Sometimes, we go back to our native language, which isn't very helpful. That's where this app jumps in to help!
                    
# What can this app do: 
- It generates 10 random numbers and displays them one after another.
- Record users’ speaking. 
- Save the recording and uses OpenAI's speech-to-text API to transcribe the user's voice to text. 
- Display the result
